# Software

## Bookmarks
- Bookmarks automatically use the "title" element's content

## Performance Options
- The "Smooth edges of screen fonts" option improves readability by smoothing edges (anti-aliasing):
  - ![](/assets/software/smooth-edges-on.png "Smooth edges on")
  - ![](/assets/software/smooth-edges-off.png "Smooth edges off")

## Google Maps
- Just because one route is shorter than another doesn't mean it's the faster one
  - This is because routes have other properties like elevation and traffic
  - Google Maps determines the fastest route by taking many factors into account, which is why it's pretty accurate

## Ad Blockers
- There are ad blocker blockers that detect ad blockers and prompt users with a pop-up to turn off their ad blockers
  - These pop-ups usually hide the scrollbar and cover the screen. These can be dealt with by removing the element from the DOM and removing the style that hides the scrollbar from the html or body element
  - Sometimes these blockers, on detection, redirect to another path, so that the user can't easily bypass the pop-up, which can be avoided by stopping the execution of the script

## Shortcuts / Standards
- Prefer English layout since:
  - Shortcuts are usually designed assuming an English layout
  - Programming languages are usually designed assuming an English layout

## Google Account Storage
- A lot of things other than files in Google Drive are stored in one's Google Account storage
  - This is why the usage of Google Drive might not match the total usage

## E-mail
- Gmail and Google Contacts show a user's profile picture from their e-mail

## Bypass Opening Links in Apps
- Try desktop mode
- Try opening the link in a new tab

## Unshorten URLs
- Shortened bit.ly links can be unshortened with a plus at the end
  - bit.ly/CbAsa => bit.ly/CbAsa+

## Picture-in-Picture
- Picture-in-Picture mode can be used to fast-forward unfast-forwardable ads

## Bypassing Copy Right Detection
- Images can be mirrored to bypass some copy right detection algorithms
