# Best Practices

1. Plan before coding.
2. Avoid hardcoding.
3. Choose the correct data structure.
4. Don't repeat anything.
5. Keep in mind that some parts might need to be updated/changed/removed, so that it's easier to maintain.
6. An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity.
7. Readability is usually more important than performance.
8. If something is specifically used over something, this should be noted.
9. It's a better idea to note why some code exists in the first place than explaining how it works.
10. Use fallbacks, ensuring that the program is failsafe.
