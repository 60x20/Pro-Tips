# Best Practices

1. Plan before coding.
2. An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity.
3. Avoid hardcoding.
4. It's a better idea to note why some code exists in the first place than explaining how it works.
5. If something is specifically used over something, this should be noted.
6. Don't repeat anything.
7. Choose the correct data structure.
8. Keep in mind that some parts might need to be updated/changed/removed, so that it's easier to maintain.
9. Readability is usually more important than performance.
10. Use fallbacks, so that the program is failsafe.
